What is a economic model?
*************************
An economic model is a theoretical framework that is used to represent economic activity in
a quantitative manner. Usually, a model will consist of equations and graphs to
aid the analysis of the problem at hand. Models are helpful in the sense that they can be
used to gain insight into economic processes and even derive useful conclusions -
such as via forecasting.

What is an Input-Output model?
*******************************
An input\â€“output model is an economic model that represents the
interdependencies between different sectors (or regions) of a national economy.
It helps us analyse how a change in one sector affects itself and others across the economy.

It was developed by Wassily Leontief, who earned the Nobel Prize in Economics for this work.
